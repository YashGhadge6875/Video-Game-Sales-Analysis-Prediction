## Machine Learning Models
This project involves training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to improve predictive accuracy. The key steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing data.
2. **Splitting the Data:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Selection:**
   - **Linear Regression:** Used as a baseline model.
   - **Lasso Regression:** Applied to reduce overfitting by adding L1 regularization.
   - **Decision Tree Regressor:** Used to capture non-linear patterns in the data.
   - **XGBoost Regressor:** Implemented for better accuracy due to its boosting technique.
4. **Model Training:** Fitting each model to the training data.
5. **Evaluation:** Measuring performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
6. **Predictions & Insights:** Using the trained models to make predictions and compare performance.
